"""
Take a list and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list
that are less than 5.

Extras:

1) Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that
   has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out
   this new list.
2) Write this in one line of Python.
3) Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only
   elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number
   given by the user.
