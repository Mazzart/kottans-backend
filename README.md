## 1. Git and Github
I have gained new and expand existing knowledge of Git version control system. The Udacity course "How to use Git and Github" was a good starting point and gave a good overview of basic Git usage (create a repo, commit changes, review the history of commits, etc). I learned new commands, how to use them and what information they provide for example:

`git log —oneline` list one commit per line, shows the first 7 characters of the commit’s SHA and the commit message;

`git log —stat` displays the file(s) that have been modified, the number of lines that have been added/removed and a summary line with the total number of modified files and lines that have been added/removed;

`git log -p` or `git log —patch` displays the files that have been modified, the location of the lines that have been added/removed and the actual changes that have been made;

`git tag` add a marker on a specific commit;

`git commit --amend` alter the most-recent commit;

`git revert` reverses given commit (you have to provide SHA).

Other materials help to further improve skills and can be used in the future.
